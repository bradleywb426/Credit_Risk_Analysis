# Credit Risk Analysis

## Overview

In this challenge, we used different techniques to train and evaluate models to handle the unbalanced classes of good and risky credit loans. The dataset from LendingClub was both over and under sampled, and then sampled using a combinatorial approach of over and under sampling. Then, two machine learning models were employed to predict credit risk.

## Results

Using bulleted lists, describe the balanced accuracy scores and the precision and recall scores of all six machine learning models. Use screenshots of your outputs to support your results.

## Summary

Summarize the results of the machine learning models, and include a recommendation on the model to use, if any. If you do not recommend any of the models, justify your reasoning.
